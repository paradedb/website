We're excited to unveil our rebranded [landing page](https://www.paradedb.com) and [docs](https://docs.paradedb.com). For the past year, the ParadeDB team has
been focused on growing adoption of our open source project among the developer community. The old branding — dark mode with bright emerald as the primary color — reflected that.

Today, we're reaching an inflection point where ParadeDB has been deployed across thousands of production environments on multi-terabyte clusters. Our revamped landing page
and brand aesthetics highlight our commitment to supporting these larger customers.

In parallel, we've been working on a managed version of ParadeDB called Parade BYOC. Built for customers who use managed Postgres providers like Amazon
RDS, Parade BYOC runs as a search replica directly in your organization's AWS/Azure/Google Cloud account. To request early access, we invite you to [speak with our team](https://calendly.com/paradedb).

That's all for now — back to building!
