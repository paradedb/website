Agentic search refers to information retrieval performed by AI agents rather than human users. Unlike traditional search where humans formulate queries and interpret results, agentic search involves AI agents autonomously planning search strategies, executing queries, and processing results to accomplish specific tasks.

While agentic search isn't a category of search (it's based on existing full-text, vector, and hybrid search technologies), it's valuable to understand what agents need from search and how we can optimize our search systems to support their unique patterns.

## How Agents Use Search

Agents run and combine existing search technologies in ways that differ fundamentally from human search patterns:

- **Multi-Query Workflows**: Break down complex information needs into sequences of targeted queries, then synthesize results across multiple searches
- **Programmatic Iteration**: Rapidly reformulate queries based on result analysis, testing different keywords, filters, or search methods within milliseconds
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain search context across multiple queries, using early findings to inform later query formulation and result evaluation

The most common way to enable agents is to expose search interfaces as tools in an MCP (model context protocol) server, but there are also other options like cetnering the search around a single technology that can access to all types of search. SQL makes a good candidate for this pattern.

## What Agents Need from Search Systems

To support agentic workflows, search systems must accommodate unique agent requirements:

- **Parameter Transparency**: Access to search parameters like similarity thresholds, result counts, and source filtering to optimize queries based on result quality
- **Multi-Method Access**: Ability to choose between [vector search](/learn/search-concepts/vector-search), [full-text search](/learn/search-concepts/full-text-search), and [hybrid search](/learn/search-concepts/hybrid-search) approaches programmatically
- **Result Metadata**: Access to relevance scores, confidence metrics, and ranking factors to evaluate result quality and refine search strategies
- **Reliable APIs**: Consistent, well-documented interfaces that enable seamless integration without handling unpredictable response formats

## Agentic Search vs RAG

Agentic search builds upon [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](/learn/search-concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation) but represents a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive information gathering. While RAG typically performs single retrievals based on user input—searching once and appending results to prompts—agentic search involves agents planning multi-step query sequences and iteratively refining their approach based on result quality.

The key difference lies in autonomy and control. RAG systems generally hide search complexity from users, performing retrieval as a background process to augment LLM responses. Agentic search gives agents direct control over search parameters, methods, and result evaluation, enabling them to build persistent knowledge across multiple searches rather than treating each query in isolation.

This evolution enables agents to follow information trails, cross-reference sources, and adapt their search strategies dynamically. This transforms information retrieval from a simple context augmentation tool into a sophisticated research capability that agents can run strategically throughout complex workflows.

## Summary

Agentic search describes how AI agents leverage existing search technologies to accomplish tasks that would be impossible through human-driven search alone. By understanding agent requirements like parameter transparency, reliable APIs, and result metadata, we can optimize search systems to support agent workflows. When agents can effectively search and synthesize information autonomously, they enable capabilities from autonomous building, to proactive monitoring, to systematic research that transform how organizations handle information-intensive tasks.
