# ParadeDB

> ParadeDB is a transactional alternative to Elasticsearch built on Postgres. It is a PostgreSQL-native search and analytics engine - a columnstore index for OLAP and a BM25 inverted index for full-text search, all inside Postgres as an extension. ParadeDB makes Postgres fast for both analytics and search without ETL or external systems.
